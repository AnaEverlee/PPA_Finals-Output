# PPA_Finals-Output

The **'index.html'** file is the HTML document containing the content for our website's homepage which comprises the introduction, topics, team, and references. Our task is to individually create webpages for our assigned topics and link them to 'index.html' in order to successfully create a website. The HTML files for the topics will be named 'topic-1', 'topic-2', 'topic-3', and so on.

I've attached in this repository 'index.html', 'topic-3.html', 'style.css', and the images used for the website. You may download all of them into your laptop/PC and save it into a folder named 'PPA_Finals'. Inside the 'PPA_Finals' folder, create another folder called 'img' and move all the images there so they will successfully load when you open the website in your local computer. **Note: Do NOT change anything in 'index.html', 'topic-3', and 'style.css' as any changes made will not sync automatically with the files in my local computer**

kindly download "topic-number' to start working on the HTML document. You may view topic-3.html to guide your work (don't forget to replace the 'number' to the actual topic number later on!). For the design in the website's navigation menu to apply in your local computer, kindly add <link rel='stylesheet" href="style.css"> inside your HTML document's <head> tags. Another option is to copy the design for the nav inside 'style.css' to your own stylesheet/HTML document. It is also completely up to you if you want your CSS to be inside your HTML document's <style> tags, or if you want to create a separate CSS file for all the design.

Here are the hex values for the colors used and font faces:
- pink - #FBF1EE
- blue - #CFE7EB
- golden - #E2C252
- headings: font-family: "Noto Sans Display", sans-serif;
- paragraphs: font-family: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif;

How to display HTML tags as plain text?
Replace the opening tag **<** with **&lt ;** and the closing tag **>** with **&gt ;** (Note just remove the space between the letter 't' and the semi-colon)

Besides that, kindly do the ff:
- Upload a formal image of you which will be displayed in "Meet the Team" section.
- Provide a super concise description (not more than 8 words for each bullet) describing the school where you (1) graduated SHS, (2) your hobbies, and (3) your aspirations. For example: <br>

    ðŸŒ¸ Loves reading, writing, and playing sports <br>
    ðŸŒ¸ Aspires to become a UI/UX designer <br>
