# PPA_Finals-Output

The **'index.html'** file is the HTML document containing the content for our website's homepage which comprises the introduction, topics, team, and references. Our task is to individually create webpages for our assigned topics and link them to 'index.html' in order to successfully create a website. The HTML files for the topics will be named 'topic-1', 'topic-2', 'topic-3', and so on.

I've attached in this repository 'index.html', 'topic-3.html', 'style.css', and the images used for the website. You may download all of them into your laptop/PC and save it into a folder named 'PPA_Finals'. Inside the 'PPA_Finals' folder, create another folder called 'img' and move all the images there so they will successfully load when you open the website in your local computer. **Note: Do NOT change anything in 'index.html', 'topic-3', and 'style.css' as any changes made will not sync automatically with the files in my local computer**

kindly download "topic-number' to start working on the HTML document. You may view topic-3.html to guide your work (don't forget to replace the 'number' to the actual topic number later on!)

Here are the hex values for the colors used and font faces:
- pink - #FBF1EE
- blue - #CFE7EB
- golden - #E2C252
- headings: font-family: "Noto Sans Display", sans-serif;
- paragraphs: font-family: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif;
